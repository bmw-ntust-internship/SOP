### Decisions

- `installation-guide.md` merged into `integration-guide.md`: a single doc now covers per-component installation and end-to-end system integration, removing the need for a separate installation guide.
- Created `source-code-guide.md`: OOP principles, Adapter/Abstract Factory/Strategy design patterns (mandatory for rApp/xApp), Sphinx/Doxygen docstring formats, and standard folder structure.
- README sections 2–5 restructured: Section 4 renamed to "Simulation & Data Pipeline" (adds InfluxDB/Grafana/YouTube/pCloud requirements); Section 5 split into 5.1 Oral-Exam (personal graduation, ordered by priority), 5.2 Project Handover (grouped A→D: GitHub → Docs → Simulation → Review), 5.3 Handover Candidates table.
- `ea0fab6` also introduced "Student Progress Stages (by Year)" section in README: a rubric table distinguishing First-year (Proposal Stage) from Second-year (Execution Stage) deliverables.
- Prompt B added to `daily-log.md §Auto Daily-log`: offline mode that reconciles 4 files (CLAUDE.md, CONTEXT.md, MEMORY.md, TODO.md) instead of relying on MySQL. Prompt A (MySQL) drafted but commented out pending VM access verification.
- Introduced 3 new project memory files (CONTEXT.md, MEMORY.md, TODO.md) committed to the SOP repo root.

### Patterns Established

- Integration guide = single doc for "how to get the full system running" (installation + integration in one place).
- Checklist items in Section 5.2 use grouped headings A→B→C→D to establish explicit priority order.
- 4-file Prompt B pattern: CLAUDE.md (static snapshot) + CONTEXT.md (living architecture) + MEMORY.md (decisions) + TODO.md (backlog).
- Daily-log automation tool lives at `bmw-ece-ntust/progress-plan` → local clone `~/Documents/GitHub/daily-logs/`.

### Gotchas

- `raycg` had no prior commits in this repo; author email must be supplied explicitly as `--author="Ray-Guang Cheng <crg@mail.ntust.edu.tw>"`.
- `git mv` fails on untracked (new) files — use plain `mv` + `git add` instead.
- Force-push was needed to fix author on an already-pushed commit; remote allowed it with a "Bypassed rule violations" warning despite a branch protection rule.
- Apparent git state confusion mid-session: `ea0fab6` showed as HEAD despite earlier commits. Cause: the `ea0fab6` commit was already in the remote and incorporated all session changes; local HEAD matched remote after sync.

### Decisions

- LTM migrated from MySQL to **per-user PostgreSQL**, managed by the `bmw-ece-ntust/llm-skill-ltm` repo. The earlier MySQL `llm_memory` setup (Prompt A, `mysql-memory` MCP) is retired and removed from all active docs. `lab-automation/llm-memory.md` rewritten as a PostgreSQL overview pointing to `llm-skill-ltm`; the SessionStart hook there records activity automatically in both Claude Code and Cowork.
- LTM `metadata` now keeps `owner` (the GitHub account that owns the repo, org or personal) and `repo` (name only) as **separate fields**, so daily-log activities group per project.
- `daily-log.md` format updated: each daily-log bullet is one session on one project, tagged `[owner/repo]`, with required `hh:mm - hh:mm` start/end times. Tasks may overlap because agentic AI runs tasks concurrently. The auto-commit `Work Start` field now carries a `yyyy/mm/dd: hh.mm - hh.mm` range.

### Patterns Established

- Project identity in the LTM and in daily-log bullets is always `owner` + `repo` as separate fields/tags, never a single `owner/repo` string embedded in the repo field.
- Overlapping daily-log time ranges across different `[owner/repo]` projects are expected and allowed.

### Gotchas

- `MEMORY.md` is append-only: the prior MySQL mention in the 2026-05-25 entry stays as a historical record; this entry supersedes it rather than editing it.

## 2026-06-29

### Decisions

- Committed the accumulated PostgreSQL-LTM migration work (docs rewrite across `daily-log.md`, `lab-automation/llm-memory.md`, `project-documentation.md`, `source-code-guide.md`, copilot-instructions, and the 4 project files) together as one daily-log push.
- Adopted `AGENTS.md` as the tool-neutral preference base (seeded by `sync-to-all-repos.sh`); `CLAUDE.md` and other tool adapters defer to it. Added it and `.claude/settings.json` to the CLAUDE.md / CONTEXT.md file maps.
- Push performed across all 5 dirty "llm-refs" repos in one go: SOP, llm-prefs, daily-log, progress-plan (daily-logs), llm-skill-logging.

### Gotchas

- `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/model-policy.state.json`, and `graphify-out/` are now gitignored; `.claude/settings.json` (the per-repo model/effort pin) is tracked and committed.

## 2026-06-30

### Decisions

- Reconciled `AGENTS.md` from the `sync-to-all-repos.sh` stub into a real tool-neutral base for this docs repo: behavior (no auto-commit, concise), writing conventions (GFM callouts, numbered headings, fully-numeric checklist IDs, "Section" spelled out, no section-sign, integration-guide command/output blocks), the four-file memory system, git workflow (author + co-author trailer, stage-by-name, multi-day per-day `work duration`), and the daily-log/LTM contract.
- Refined `daily-log.md` format to **one task block per `[owner/repo]`**: the 7-digit short-hash commit link is the block's evidence, with activities grouped by hours under it; parallel repos are separate blocks with overlapping ranges allowed; an unknown start is `??:?? - hh:mm` (never invented); a calendar meeting without minutes yet is a placeholder `[<title>](minutes 7-hash link)`. Wired graphify-first into the Auto Daily-log reconcile prompt and kept the per-day `work duration` block.

### Gotchas

- The `**Reviewed by**: <GitHub username>` placeholder must be left as-is by the agent; only the responsible human fills it to certify they verified LLM-written content (daily-log, minutes, docs).

## 2026-07-01

### Decisions

- Refined `daily-log.md`: added the **Evidence links** tiered policy (commit tree for a summary, line-range permalink for a single-file edit, doc section header otherwise; always the 7-digit hash); split **Auto Daily-log** into **Step 1 — Commit** (reconcile + commit + push) and **Step 2 — Post to `progress-plan#366`**, since the fenced prompt is the commit workflow, not the GitHub post; added per-task durations + grouped long-span form + a **Determining durations** method; merged the review callouts into one rule (🤖 AI-generated marker + empty `Reviewed by`, filled by the human on verify).
- Extended `integration-guide.md`: generate installation docs from the captured terminal log (`termlog`) — required critical-path steps only, debugging to the bottom.
- Refined the live GitHub daily-log (`progress-plan#366`) for 19 days since the first LTM: new structure, real durations (termlog ∪ STM ∪ clamped worklog), tiered evidence links, AI-generated marker + empty `Reviewed by`.

### Gotchas

- The lab LTM connector migrated Bitwarden→Vault; this machine has no Vault, so a **dual-backend** `pg-memory-conn.sh` (Vault preferred, Bitwarden fallback) was restored locally in `llm-skill-ltm`. Bitwarden's field cache goes stale, so `ltm_bw_session` now runs `bw sync`.
- GitHub issue comments can't carry a separate author; AI attribution on the daily-log uses a body marker + `Co-authored-by: Claude` trailer, not a real committer.
- 6 daily-log bullets remain `??:??` (older days predating termlog, with open worklog sessions) — backfill from other machines later.

## 2026-07-02

### Decisions

- **Guard rule — never push without GitHub-admin review.** Since the SOP governs lab operation, an unreviewed change can disrupt every member. Added the rule to `AGENTS.md` (Git Workflow, first bullet) and `CLAUDE.md` (a `> [!CAUTION]` at the top of Git Commit Convention): agents may stage/commit locally on request but must stop before pushing/merging to `master` and hand off to a repo admin (Ian or Bimo). This explicitly overrides the "`git push` = intent to push" behavior for this repo.
- Reverted `project-documentation.md` to the `d117b96` version (README-oriented template, ~1123 lines), undoing the later CONTEXT.md-oriented rewrite.

### Patterns Established

- Guard rules for shared/operational repos live in the tool-neutral `AGENTS.md` base and are mirrored into each tool adapter (`CLAUDE.md`); adapters defer to `AGENTS.md`.

### Gotchas

- Files changed since `d117b96` besides the daily-log rewrite: `.claude/settings.json`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TODO.md`, `integration-guide.md`, `lab-automation/llm-memory.md` (MySQL→PostgreSQL), `logistics/meeting.md`, `source-code-guide.md`, and `project-documentation.md` (now reverted).

## 2026-07-02 (cont.)

### Decisions

- Renamed `integration-guide.md` → **`implementation-guide.md`** (it is the SOP guideline for an LLM to write the step-by-step *implementation* of a system in the correct order — installation + integration + verification). Updated every reference and label (README, CONTEXT, CLAUDE file list, daily-log, user-guide incl. TOC anchor). The `/integration-guide` skill name is unchanged (global skill, not the file).
- Rewrote the guide to be essential/concise/precise and re-ordered it: a lean **How to Write This Guide** preamble (4 rules: one command+`#`output per block keeping only success/failure lines and skipping the rest with `...`; shortest successful path in the right order with debugging at the bottom; generate from the termlog; one-touch LLM-over-SSH deploy) followed by the fill-in template in build order (Project → Architecture → Execution Status → Access → Repo/Config → Installation → E2E → Verification → Known Issues → Troubleshooting → Resources). Trimmed noisy example outputs to demonstrate the `...` convention; kept the full O-RAN (O1/E2/R1/InfluxDB/Grafana) verification block. ~787 → ~600 lines.

### Gotchas

- The old file had a markdown bug: the `## Access Method` heading was concatenated onto the end of the "Target Users:" line — fixed into its own section during the rewrite.
- The guard rule was satisfied for this push by the user's explicit "I accept this one" (human sign-off), not by leaving it unpushed.

### Patterns Established

- Guideline docs read best as **How-to-write rules first, fill-in template second**, with example command outputs trimmed via `...` so the guide practises the conciseness it preaches.
